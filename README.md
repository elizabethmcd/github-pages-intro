Creating a Personal Website Using Github Pages
==========

Lesson materials for teaching introduction to Github Pages, and creating a personal website with Github pages manually, using the command line, and interfacing with Jekyll. This lesson assumes that the learner already has knowledge of the basics of git, which are described in the [Software Carpentry](software-carpentry.org)[git-novice lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), from which this lesson was derived and formatted from.
